# TODO:

#### - Use ideas given in this link https://github.com/hcmus1712331/LTCKHDL-DACK/blob/master/1712331-NguyenThanhDat.ipynb to represent the meaning of each column.

#### - Change column meaning session in `chapter 01` to be the same as in `chapter 02`.

#### - Continue on `chapter 02`.

#### - On `chapter 03`, we need to give quick introduction to the data, then give about 4 questions based on the above introduction.
